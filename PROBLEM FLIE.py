# MY FIRST PROBLEM

'''Sir  python is not accepting any variable and and is constantly showing
syntax error. But i am not able to understand why it is doing so while
creating any variable. Because of this problem, I am also not able to create
any heading also. I am getting this problem while making a biodata'''

## HERE IS THE PROGRAMMING
print{
    'Vaani':{

        'name' : 'Vaani Gupta'

    }
} 


''' Sir please guide to where I am making a folly/mistake and how shall
I proceed?'
